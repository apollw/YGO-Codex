# Yu-Gi-Oh! Codex

Yu-Gi-Oh! Codex is a static website built strictly from scratch, using only manually written HTML, CSS and JavaScript, with the goal of deeply understanding web fundamentals before introducing frameworks or automation.

## Project Rules (Self-Imposed)

This project follows strict rules by design:

- No frameworks (React, Bootstrap, etc.)
- No generators or templates
- No build tools
- No automation (for now)
- No copy-paste driven development
- Everything written by hand, starting from the basics
- Abstractions are introduced only after their necessity is fully understood

## Purpose

The focus is not speed, but understanding.

This project aims to:
- Master HTML semantics (lists, tables, sections, headings)
- Separate structure (HTML) from layout and style (CSS)
- Learn the box model, normal flow, Flexbox, and Grid from first principles
- Experience the real cost of repetition before adding JavaScript or dynamic data
- Reduce dependency on tools, frameworks, and AI assistance

## Scope

- Static catalog of Yu-Gi-Oh! booster packs and cards
- Explicit data representation in HTML before automation
- Progressive layout refinement using pure CSS

## Current Stack

- HTML (manual)
- CSS (manual)
- JavaScript (planned after fundamentals are exhausted)

## Philosophy

Understand first.  
Automate later.  
Tools should accelerate knowledge, not replace it.
